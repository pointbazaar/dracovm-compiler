//this is an example of how a '.dracovm.info' file could look.
//each line starts with the name of a subroutine file.
//the files are usually prefixed with a '.' so they are
//not shown be default

//the parts of a line (the description of a subroutine to the dracovm compiler)
//are seperated by a ';'

//Part 1: FILENAME
//Part 2: ',' - seperated list of dependencies (in their representation as a filename) 
//	  (which other subroutines it calls)
//	  This is neccessary to check if all these dependencies exist in the directory
//	  and were specified as arguments to the dracovm compiler
//	  meaning if the '.asm' outputs of the compiler exist, 
//	  therefore their '.o' object file equivalents should exist,
//	  so everything can be linked together by 'ld' at the end.
//Part 3: name of the generated '.asm' file

// FILENAME;DEPENDENCY1,DEPENDENCY2, ... ;ASSEMBLY_FILENAME;HASH OF FILE
