BUILTIN SUBROUTINES:

        putchar(Char c)         //prints the char on top of stack, the basis for all output
        putdigit(PInt digit)    //prints the digit on top of stack to console. works like putchar,
                        //except it adds some offset to make an ascii char from an int

        readint()               //reads an integer from stdin, pushes it on the stack.

        int2char(Integer i)     //converts an integer to its asciichar equivalent
                        //it takes the top of stack, pops it, converts it to char
                        //then pushes it

        float2int(Float f)      //these explain themselves,
        int2float(Integer i)    //and just change the top of stack from one to the other type
