BUILTIN SUBROUTINES:
                        //these builtin subroutines are considered essential

        putchar(Char c)         //prints the char on top of stack, the basis for all output
        putdigit(PInt digit)    //prints the digit on top of stack to console. works like putchar,
                        //except it adds some offset to make an ascii char from an int

        readint()               //reads an integer from stdin, pushes it on the stack.

        int2char(Integer i)     //converts an integer to its asciichar equivalent
                        //it takes the top of stack, pops it, converts it to char
                        //then pushes it

        float2int(Float f)      //these explain themselves,
        int2float(Integer i)    //and just change the top of stack from one to the other type

        malloc(PInt size) //returns a pointer to the allocated memory. size means the size in DWORDs

                //amount is the amount of DWORDs (4 Bytes) to be reserved
                //this is because our language currently operates in 32 bit mode
                //this instructions takes 1 argument on the stack and returns one argument on the stack
                //the return address is the address of the allocated memory



        free(Integer pointer) //frees the allocated memory
        //deallocates the previously allocated block of memory at that address

	
	arrnew(PInt size)	//TODO	//allocates a new length-prefixed segment of memory
	arrlen([#])		//TODO 	//returns the length of a length-prefixed array
